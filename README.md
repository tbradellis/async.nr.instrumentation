# async.nr.instrumentation


This is a collection of various work units for testing New Relic custom instrumentation APIs

Additionally, I have used it to learn general programming concepts, and then instrumenting those units of work with our APIs, for example learning asynchronous programming with Java or in one case learning the "builder" programming model.  
Some of our example code for our External Parameter's library uses the Builder Paradigm, so I used this space to understand that paradigm better so that I could effectively teach other developers how to user the NR APIs.
